## Employee Tracker

Developer: Steven Schmidt

# Overview

EmployeeTrack is a practice CLI application made using MySQL, Inquirer, and Node.js. It's designed to allow the user to create, view, and edit an employee database with example seeds and schema.

# Demo
[Here's an example of the application in action](https://drive.google.com/file/d/170tOK42-Pu3A5IL7iwX-QWJ5cfZJ6Z0h/view)

# Future Development

The current application is unable to differentiate between managers and departments in the viewing scheme. Ideally this would be corrected to allow for ease of navigation.
